        <h2>About Me</h2>
       <p>
I am a Computer Science student at Towson University with a strong interest in
software engineering, systems development, and secure, reliable computing.
My experience includes building and testing software in Linux and Windows
environments, developing automation and test frameworks, and collaborating
with engineers in Agile teams to deliver well-documented, maintainable solutions.
</p>

<p>
I am particularly interested in roles involving backend development, systems
integration, embedded and mission-critical software, and cloud-enabled
infrastructure. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, learning new
technologies, and applying sound engineering principles to real-world systems.
