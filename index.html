    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        I am a Computer Science student at Towson University with a strong interest in
        software engineering, systems development, and secure, reliable computing.
        My experience includes building and testing software in Linux and Windows
        environments, developing automation and test frameworks, and collaborating
        with engineers in Agile teams to deliver well-documented, maintainable solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        I am particularly interested in roles involving backend development, systems
        integration, embedded and mission-critical software, and cloud-enabled
        infrastructure. I enjoy solving complex technical problems, learning new
        technologies, and applying sound engineering principles to real-world systems.
    </p>
